// the library <ciso646> has been deprecated in C++17 and removed in C++20
// however PhysX still includes it in some of their headers
// NvCloth, Physx4, and Physx5 until we update it.

// By providing this file on GCC and Clang we can avoid the include errors
// without having to modify the PhysX or NvCloth source code

// Note that the long term plan is to upgrade or remove libraries that depend on ciso646
// so this is only a temporary fix

// to use this file in a target add a dependency on ciso646-include.
